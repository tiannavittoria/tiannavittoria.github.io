Hello World!

My name is Tianna and welcome to my personal website! 
This is the first website
I have created by myself...for myself!!!
For this site I used HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap 4.

Just a little bit about me, I am an agile and 
technology enthusiast with a CSM. For the past year 
I have been teaching myself how to code via many online 
courses and YouTube videos. I've also been learning 
everything I can about development from UX/UI to QA.

Working in a agile environment is my goal
and I wanted to create a website to 
highlight who I am and what I can do. 
Instead of working off a pre-determined 
template, and since I have been studying Front-End,
I decided to code my own website. It was a challenge!
However, with all it's challenges and all it's "hacked" together
code...I have a working website up and running! Yay! 
Can you tell I am excited?

I hope you enjoyed stopping by and learning 
a little bit about me. A hui hou. That's
hawaiian for "until we meet again."
